# Web-Scrapping-in-Python
Data scraping, also known as web scraping, is the automated process of extracting data from websites. It involves using software to simulate human browsing behavior to collect information from web pages. This information can include text, images, links, and other content.

Market research: Gathering data on products, prices, and reviews from e-commerce websites.
Competitive analysis: Extracting information about competitors' products, prices, and marketing strategies.
Lead generation: Collecting contact information from websites for sales and marketing purposes.
Content aggregation: Aggregating news articles, blog posts, or other content from multiple sources.
Data analysis: Extracting structured data for analysis, such as stock prices, weather data, or social media metrics.
